knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

$$X_t = X_{t-1} + Z_t$$
$$Z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$
```{r}
x = NULL
x[1] = 0

for (i in 2:1000) {
  # Add noise at every step
  x[i] <- x[i-1] + rnorm(1) # Add one data point
}

random_walk = ts(x) # Turn into time series
plot(random_walk, main="A Random Walk", ylab="", xlab="Days", col='blue', lwd=2)
```

This is not a stationary time series.  Don't use acf()

```{r}
acf(random_walk)
```

# Difference

Take the difference of each lag.  x_1 - x_2 , ...., x_1000 - x_999
```{r}
random_walk <- diff(random_walk)
```

```{r}
plot(random_walk)
```

```{r}
acf(random_walk)
```

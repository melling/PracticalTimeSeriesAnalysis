## Sequences

Sequence - a list of numbers in a definite order

Partial sum of sequence $\{a_n\}$

$$s_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$$

## Series

### Absolute convergence

$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |a_i|$$
Absolute convergence implies convergence.

### Geometric Series

## Backward Shift Operator

Take it back one step:

$$BX_t = X_{t-1}$$
$$B^2X_t = BBX_t = BX_{t-1} = X_{t-2}$$

Take it back k steps:
$$B^kX_t = X_{t-k}$$

## Autocorrelation

Stationary time-series:

A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.  Thus, time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary â€” the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times.

We assume 

- Weak stationarity
- Autocorrelation coefficient
$$-1 \leq \rho_k = \frac{\gamma_k}{\gamma_0} \leq 1$$
Estimation of Autocorrelation coefficient at lag k

$$r_k = \frac{c_k}{c_0}$$

# Correlogram

# Calculate Autocorrelation coefficients

Random noise

```{r}
x = 1
data = rnorm(100,0,1)
acf(2+3*x + data, main="ACF: Noise or Signal?")
```
